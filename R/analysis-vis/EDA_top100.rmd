## Introduction

Modified from the automatically generated notebook for the `drug-spending` dataset found at: 
https://data.world/data4democracy/drug-spending, showcasing the use of the `data.world` R package. * Learn more at https://github.com/datadotworld/data.world-r


### Load packages
```{r}
library(data.world)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
library(tibble)
```


### List all tables in the **drug-spending** dataset:
```{r list tables}
# Datasets are referenced by their URL or path
dataset_key <- "https://data.world/data4democracy/drug-spending"
# List tables available for SQL queries
tables_qry <- data.world::qry_sql("SELECT * FROM Tables")
tables_df <- data.world::query(tables_qry, dataset = dataset_key)
# See what is in it
tables_df$tableName
```



## Here I will only look at the 'spending_all_top100.csv' data
```{r}
  spend_qry <- data.world::qry_sql(sprintf("SELECT * FROM spending_all_top100"))
  spend_df  <- data.world::query(spend_qry, dataset = dataset_key)
  glimpse(spend_df)
```


## *Note* I originally assumed that the amounts in this file had been summed over the years. Actually from the description w/ the file on data.world (which I should have read more closely),  it is the '2011-2015 spending data combined, for the top 100 generics by total number of users in that time frame.'  There is a still a row for each year (the years have not been summed together).

We can confirm that there are 100 unique generic names in this dataset:
```{r}
print( paste('Out of ',nrow(spend_df),' rows, there are ',length(unique(spend_df$drugname_generic)),' unique generic names '))
```



### Which generics had largest total spending (for an inidivdual year) ? 

```{r}
spend_df %>% 
        arrange(desc(total_spending)) %>%           
        select(drugname_brand,drugname_generic,total_spending,year) %>% 
        head(20)
```

### Which generics had largest total spending over all 5 years?
```{r}
spend_df %>% 
        group_by(drugname_generic) %>%
        summarise(tot = sum(total_spending)) %>%
        arrange( desc(tot)) %>%
        head(20)
        
```



### Try plotting total spending by year
```{r}
spend_df %>%
        group_by(year) %>%
        summarise(tot=sum(total_spending)) %>%
        ggplot(aes(year,tot)) +
        geom_bar(stat='identity',aes(fill=as.factor(year))) +
        ylab("Total Spending") +
        ggtitle("Total Year Spending on top 100 generics")
```



### Which generic had largest difference in spending from 2011-2015 ?
- First group by generic and get yearly totals
```{r}
df_yearly <- spend_df %>%
        group_by(drugname_generic,year) %>%
        summarize(tot = sum(total_spending)) %>%
        arrange(drugname_generic,year) 
head(df_yearly)
```

- Then compute largest diff between largest and smallest price.
```{r}
df_yearly %>% 
        group_by(drugname_generic) %>%
        summarise(diff = max(tot)-min(tot)) %>%
        arrange( desc(diff))
```


###


## TO-DO
- Fit linear regression vs year to each generic, see which ones are rising the most.
- Look at price per user, not just total price.
- Look at number of users, number of low-income users, etc.
