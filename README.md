#### A [Data for Democracy](http://datafordemocracy.org/) project
# drug-spending

## Purpose
Coming soon!

## Getting started

#### Downloading this repository
To download the code and data inside this repository, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Once you've got the necessary tools, open a command prompt and run `git clone https://github.com/data4democracy/drug-spending.git` to start downloading your own working copy. Once the command finishes, you should see a new `drug-spending` directory in the current directory's file listing. That's where you'll find it!

#### Project structure (or, "how do I find `thing`?")
* **Source code and notebooks**: For now, you'll find these in the repository's root directory. This will probably change in the future as we accumulate more files.
* **Data files**: All data files are located in the `/data` directory. At the moment, there is no further hierarchy beyond this; again, as we accumulate more data, this is likely to change.

#### Performing data analysis
There are many ways to analyze the data in this repository, but two of the most common are [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install.html) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). The setup process for these tools is in-depth enough to be outside the scope of this README, so please refer to documentation at the aforementioned links if necessary. If something isn't working quite right for you, that's okay! Continue reading to see how you can reach out for assistance.

#### Talking to people/asking for help
If you have questions or you'd like to discuss something on your mind, reach out to us in the `#drug-spending` channel on Slack. Project members are available for troubleshooting, brainstorming, mentorship, and just about anything else you might need. We'll be working more to define project roles and representatives in the near future, so check this README often for updates!

## System requirements
* Git (check out the [github-playground](https://github.com/data4democracy/github-playground) repository if you need a good place to get accustomed)
* An analytical language of your choice (Python, R, Julia, etc.)
* Python 3 (for Jupyter/`.ipynb` notebook files)
* RStudio (for RStudio/`.Rmd` notebook files)

## Completed goals
* Retrieve and clean [Medicare Part D spending data](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Information-on-Prescription-Drugs/2015MedicareData.html) from CMS
* Retrieve a listing of codes that link drugs to their therapeutic use(s)

## To be completed
* **More data**: We could really use some more data to give our analyses some depth and relatability.
* ***Lots more ideas to come***: Join us in #drug-spending on Slack to contribute your ideas!
